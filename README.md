# Awesome List of Bufale
> A curated list of websites known for publishing "bufale".

Bufale are unverified, wrong facts and anecdotes, to which a fair amount of
people seem to believe. In Italian, we use the term "bufale" to refer to these
"unverified facts," but unfortunately there is no English translation for that.
However, I noticed that in other countries and languages there are websites
from which people should stay away from. The purpose of this list is to
enumerate the very bad and most popular ones.

This, as many others, is inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing.

# Work in Progress
This list is a work in progress. As of now, we're consolidating the existing
blacklists from the various public blacklists into a [JSON
file](https://github.com/phretor/awesome-bslist/blob/master/sources.json). Pull
requests are welcomed!
